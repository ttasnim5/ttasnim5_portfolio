                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Tahsin! I am currently a senior Computer Science major at Boston 
                    University, set to graduate in 2025. My interests in the field primarily revolve around 
                    backend development, cybersecurity, and sustainability in technology. 
                </p> 

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I'm drawn to backend work because I find it both challenging and rewarding, and 
                        I've already gained some valuable experience in this area through personal and work 
                        projects.

                    Cybersecurity fascinates me, especially given its dynamic nature and the constant 
                    innovation required to keep pace with emerging threats.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As for sustainability, I'm passionate about aligning the technological world with our 
                        environment. I believe we have abundant collective intelligence to make significant strides 
                        in sustainable tech solutions.
                    </li>
                </ul>  

                <p>
                    In my professional journey so far, I've made a conscious effort to explore diverse industries, 
                    including food service, receptionist work, historical work, and tech (of course). This varied 
                    experience has been essential in broadening my perspective and helping me understand different 
                    types of work. A common thread throughout my experiences has been an emphasis on people and 
                    relationships, especially with teamwork, collaboration, and customer service. I really value 
                    those human connections, I think they  make work meaningful and remind us of the real-world 
                    impact of our efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By learning from people across various sectors and engaging in different forms of interpersonal
                    work, I've aimed to both become a well-rounded individual and gain clarity on my career aspirations. 
                    This exploration has not only influenced my professional outlook but also reinforced my passion for 
                    technology and its potential to make a positive impact.

                    Some of my side hobbies include rock climbing, swimming, crochet, making simple furniture, and 
                    visiting parks :)
