          I've built up these skills through my academic and independent studies, as well as various work 
          experiences. I'm good at using my tech know-how along with my people skills to work well in 
          teams and explain tricky concepts in ways that make sense. I enjoy putting all these different 
          abilities to use to come up with creative solutions to problems.
