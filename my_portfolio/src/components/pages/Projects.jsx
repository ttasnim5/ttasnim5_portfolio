            <h3>TikTok TechJam 2024: Ethical Consumption App</h3>
            <p>
                In this recent hackathon, I explored front-end development for a mobile app aimed at promoting 
                ethical consumption. Using React Native, I crafted a responsive, user-friendly, and visually 
                appealing interface to my teamâ€™s app, integrating various APIs to bring our vision to life. Working 
                against the clock, we managed to create a fully functional prototype that we were proud to present. 
                This experience really honed my ability to learn new concepts on the fly and work efficiently under 
                pressure, and also reinforced the importance of clear communication in a fast-paced environment.

            <h3>Civic Tech Hackathon: University Event Aggregator</h3>
            <p>
                This project was born from a common frustration among students--the challenge of keeping track of 
                various campus events. Our team of four developed a web application that uses maps and timelines to 
                consolidate academic and extracurricular events for universities and organizations. I dove into HTML, 
                data configuration and MapBox navigation to configure my portion of the application. The experience 
                taught me a lot about turning a simple idea into a practical solution, as well as navigating the 
                difficulties of working in a team.

            <h3>Regeneron STEM Institute: Musculoskeletal Disorders and Psychology Research</h3>
            <p>
                At the Regeneron STEM Instituteat Yonkers Partners in Education, I investigated multiple different 
                research directions, my favorite being the social intersections of musculoskeletal disorders. This 
                project centered data science and analysis, while also championing collaboration, exchange, and 
                discussion between our fellow researchers. The project culminated in presentations at several prestigious
                competitions, including the Westlake Science Fair, Regeneron STS, and Regeneron WESEF, where I was honored 
                to receive the Innovations in Biological Sciences Research Award in 2020. This experience not only expanded 
                my research skills but also taught me the value of perseverance in scientific inquiry.

            <h3>External Liaison Work with FFNUS</h3>
            <p>During my exchange at the National University of Singapore (NUS), I was thrilled to join the External Liaison 
                Team for Fossil Free NUS (FFNUS), where I've had the opportunity to engage in environmental advocacy. My role 
                involves reaching out to various organizations in the cause, building connections, and promoting alternatives 
                to fossil fuels. It's also been eye-opening to conduct research on student environmental preferences and future
                goals, translating these findings into comprehensive reports. This experience has sharpened my communication 
                skills and deepened my understanding of environmental issues in a university context.

            <h3>Game Development Projects</h3>
            <p>
                My passion for coding often expresses itself through game development, where I've had the chance to collaborate
                with talented teammates on some fun projects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dinosaur Runner: Using PyGame, we created a fun running and obstacle-based game featuring dinosaurs. This 
                    project was a great way to apply my Python skills in a creative context, learning about game physics and 
                    user interaction along the way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    CLI Gaming System: In a different approach to game development, I worked on a command-line interface (CLI) 
                    based gaming system. This project includes classic games like Hangman and Tic Tac Toe, challenging us to 
                    create engaging gameplay experiences within the constraints of a text-based interface. It was a great 
                    exercise in logical thinking and user experience design, even without complex graphics.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These projects have not only been enjoyable to work on but have also enhanced my problem-solving skills and 
                ability to work effectively in team settings. They represent my interest in creating interactive, engaging 
                experiences through code.
